# SudokuBoy
A Sudoku game written in x86 Assembly.

This is an old project I made back in college (2010). I fixed some of the bugs and cleaned it up so that it can be compiled from source.

Only runs on 32-bit Windows.

## Building and Running
You need _Turbo Assembler 5 (TASM)_ or any compatible assembler. Edit `build_and_run.bat` so that it points to the correct paths of `tasm.exe` and `tlink.exe`. 

Running the batch file would generate the `.exe` file inside the `bin` folder and would then run it automatically.

## How to Play
Click on an empty tile using your mouse, enter any character from your keyboard, press the Enter key to accept your entry. Level ends when you have filled the whole board.

## Contributing
The game still has a number of bugs. Plus, there may be incorrect comments and unused code. Bug reports and pull requests are always welcome.
